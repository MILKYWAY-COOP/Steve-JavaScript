Variables are containers for storing data values.
The value of a variable can change throughout the program.

Declaring a variable is as simple as using the keyword var.
Which would look like this:

var x = 10;

But why write code that is never going to be executed. Isn’t that a waste of time?
Not at all! Comments are a good idea, especially ones relating to large functions,
as they help make our code more readable for others. So be kind, and comment!

What if we have more to say?

If we want to create a multi-line comment, we write it between /*and */
Like this:
/* this code creates an alert box */

Booleans

Not just fun to say, Booleans in JavaScript serve a useful function by
letting you have one of two values, either true or false.

So when you need a data type that can only have one of two possible values,
like Yes/No, on/off or true/false, look no further than Mr Boolean.

Increment ++
The increment operator increases the numeric value of its operand by 1. When placed
before the operand, it’ll return the incremented value. When placed after it,
it’ll return the original value and then increments the operand.

Decrement --
The decrement operator decreases the numeric value of its operand by 1.
When placed before the operand, it’ll return the decremented value. When placed
after the operand, it’ll return the original value and then decrements the operand.

Switch


But what if you need to test for multiple conditions?
In those cases, writing if else statements for each condition might not be
the best solution.

Instead, we can use the switch statement to perform different actions based
on different conditions.
