There are two ways to declare variables in ECMAScript;
1. Using const keyword. Note that when using const, the variables
value cannot change over time.
2. Using the let keyword. When using let, the varible can only
be used in one scope. 

* Prototype
-Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, 
which is called its prototype.
-The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will
have its own prototype, making what is called a prototype chain.
-The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for
its own prototype.
